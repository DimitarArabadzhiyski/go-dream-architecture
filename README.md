# Go Dream Architecture
An attempt to build a maintainable architecture in go projects, based on Hexagonal Architecture, The Clean Architecture, Onion Architecture, DDD, etc.

This project is based on the current materials:

The whole code is based on my view about "clean architecture" and how to build maintainable projects. This repo is motivated by the absense of good base projects for the golang community and I hope it can be helpful for you as for me.
